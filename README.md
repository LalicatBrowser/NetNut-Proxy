## Important Information:  

A. For getting the right Netnut Proxy Setting, we take Rotating Residential IPs as HTTP Type for example, the normal [Login User] format is:[username-res-any].  

a).Username in the [username-res-any] should be your proxy login name(as former has mentioned: LalicatB).  

b).res in the username-res-any means residential IPs.  

c). any in the [username-res-any] means any country. if we keep “any” unchanged, the IP will be changed from one country to another. if we want to select a certain country for different browser profiles, we can use “us” equal to “USA“, the right type is “LalicatB-res-us“. For more country code, we can view our account backend in Netnut as the following screenshot or view link:https://l.netnut.io/countries

B. We also take static residential IPs in HTTP Type for example, the normal login user format is [username-stc-any-sid-8 digits]. Here, The meaning of username and any is the same as A Part, the STC and sid-8 digits are different, simple explanation listed as follow:  

a). Stc clearly means static.  

b) The 8 digits can be any number between 1-99999999, we can type it randomly as 69874108, not 12345678.  

So that we can get an accurate Login user: [LalicatB-stc-any-69874108]  

C. Netnut also supports HTTPS and Socks5. We take USA Proxy, for example, the right format listed as follows:  

Proxy Type: socks 5.  
Proxy IP Address: gw-socks-am.ntnt.io (USA).  
Port: 9595.
